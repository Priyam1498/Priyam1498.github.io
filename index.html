    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Priyam Srivastava, currently pursuing my <strong>PhD</strong> in Information Sciences at <strong>the University of Pittsburgh</strong>. My academic journey has led me to the intersection of <strong>Quantum Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Quantum Technologies</strong>, where I am deeply passionate about developing cutting-edge solutions for quantum sensing and network technologies.</p>
    
    <p>I have a solid foundation in Physics, having completed my Master's degree at the <strong>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)</strong>, Bhopal, where I developed skills in both experimental and theoretical quantum technologies. My current research focuses on <strong>Variational Quantum Algorithms</strong> and their applications in Quantum Sensing and Quantum Networks.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond academia, I love to read and immerse myself in different worlds through books. I'm also an avid anime fan and enjoy watching shows that explore complex themes and characters. Whenever I get the chance, I like to go out on treks, exploring the natural beauty of new places, which refreshes and inspires me.</p>
